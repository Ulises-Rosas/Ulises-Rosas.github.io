This is Ulises and I'm interested in the evolutionary biology of marine
organisms. This interest has pushed me to spent most of my time developing/using
bioinformatic tools to answer questions in evolutionary biology and ecology. This
homepage is designed to ocassionally post some thoughts on code, fish and evolution
